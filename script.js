// Challenge: Dynamic Cards
// Create an HTML page that contains a text area and a button labeled Create.
// When the user enters in text into the text area and then clicks the create button, use a factory function that creates a new DOM component that has a border, and includes it's own delete button.
// Insert that new component into the DOM.
// When the user clicks the Delete button, the containing card, and no other cards, should then be removed from the DOM. Not just made invisible, actually removed from the DOM.
